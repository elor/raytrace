# raytracezeug

Inspired by "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" <https://raytracing.github.io/>, which I didn't read or follow beforehand.

## Tools and Disclaimer

At the time of writing, I'm working with Windows using Ubuntu 20.04 under WSLv1.
Depending on my mood, I'm using vim or CLion for development, and HoneyView <https://www.bandisoft.com/honeyview/> for viewing, which reloads the image immediately.

Do with the code whatever you'd like.
If you find it useful, I'd be surprised.
